<td><pre class="screen">boolean</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">TRUE</pre></td>
<td>Whether or not the connection should be automatically connected by NetworkManager when the resources for the connection are available. TRUE to automatically activate the connection, FALSE to require manual intervention to activate the connection. Note that autoconnect is not implemented for VPN profiles. See "secondaries" as an alternative to automatically connect VPN profiles.</td>

<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">autoconnect-priority</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">int32</pre></td>

<td><pre class="screen">int32</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">-1</pre></td>
<td>The number of times a connection should be tried when autoactivating before giving up. Zero means forever, -1 means the global default (4 times if not overridden). Setting this to 1 means to try activation only once before blocking autoconnect. Note that after a timeout, NetworkManager will try to autoconnect again.</td>

<td><pre class="screen">autoconnect-slaves</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">NMSettingConnectionAutoconnectSlaves (int32)</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>Whether or not slaves of this connection should be automatically brought up when NetworkManager activates this connection. This only has a real effect for master connections. The properties "autoconnect", "autoconnect-priority" and "autoconnect-retries" are unrelated to this setting. The permitted values are: 0: leave slave connections untouched, 1: activate all the slave connections with this connection, -1: default. If -1 (default) is set, global connection.autoconnect-slaves is read to determine the real value. If it is default as well, this fallbacks to 0.</td>

<td>The name of the network interface this connection is bound to. If not set, then the connection can be attached to any interface of the appropriate type (subject to restrictions imposed by other settings). For software devices this specifies the name of the created device. For connection types where interface names cannot easily be made persistent (e.g. mobile broadband or USB Ethernet), this property should not be used. Setting this property restricts the interfaces a connection can be used with, and if interface names change or are reordered the connection may be applied to the wrong interface.</td>

<td>Whether Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is enabled for the connection. LLMNR is a protocol based on the Domain Name System (DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link. The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving for the connection, "no" (0) disable LLMNR for the interface, "resolve" (1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of LLMNR host names If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for systemd-resolved currently means "yes"). This feature requires a plugin which supports LLMNR. Otherwise the setting has no effect. One such plugin is dns-systemd-resolved.</td>

If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for systemd-resolved currently means "no"). This feature requires a plugin which supports mDNS. Otherwise the setting has no effect. One such plugin is dns-systemd-resolved.</td>

<td>An array of strings defining what access a given user has to this connection.  If this is NULL or empty, all users are allowed to access this connection; otherwise users are allowed if and only if they are in this list.  When this is not empty, the connection can be active only when one of the specified users is logged into an active session.  Each entry is of the form "[type]:[id]:[reserved]"; for example, "user:dcbw:blah". At this time only the "user" [type] is allowed.  Any other values are ignored and reserved for future use.  [id] is the username that this permission refers to, which may not contain the ":" character. Any [reserved] information present must be ignored and is reserved for future use.  All of [type], [id], and [reserved] must be valid UTF-8.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">stable-id</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>This represents the identity of the connection used for various purposes. It allows to configure multiple profiles to share the identity. Also, the stable-id can contain placeholders that are substituted dynamically and deterministically depending on the context. The stable-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable and wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable. It is also used as DHCP client identifier with ipv4.dhcp-client-id=stable and to derive the DHCP DUID with ipv6.dhcp-duid=stable-[llt,ll,uuid]. Note that depending on the context where it is used, other parameters are also seeded into the generation algorithm. For example, a per-host key is commonly also included, so that different systems end up generating different IDs. Or with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy, also the device's name is included, so that different interfaces yield different addresses. The '$' character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions at runtime. Currently supported are "${CONNECTION}", "${DEVICE}", "${MAC}", "${BOOT}", "${RANDOM}". These effectively create unique IDs per-connection, per-device, per-boot, or every time. Note that "${DEVICE}" corresponds to the interface name of the device and "${MAC}" is the permanent MAC address of the device. Any unrecognized patterns following '$' are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use. You are thus advised to avoid '$' or escape it as "$$". For example, set it to "${CONNECTION}-${BOOT}-${DEVICE}" to create a unique id for this connection that changes with every reboot and differs depending on the interface where the profile activates. If the value is unset, a global connection default is consulted. If the value is still unset, the default is similar to "${CONNECTION}" and uses a unique, fixed ID for the connection.</td>

<td><pre class="screen">timestamp</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">uint64</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">0</pre></td>
<td>The time, in seconds since the Unix Epoch, that the connection was last _successfully_ fully activated. NetworkManager updates the connection timestamp periodically when the connection is active to ensure that an active connection has the latest timestamp. The property is only meant for reading (changes to this property will not be preserved).</td>

<td>Base type of the connection. For hardware-dependent connections, should contain the setting name of the hardware-type specific setting (ie, "802-3-ethernet" or "802-11-wireless" or "bluetooth", etc), and for non-hardware dependent connections like VPN or otherwise, should contain the setting name of that setting type (ie, "vpn" or "bridge", etc).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">uuid</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>A universally unique identifier for the connection, for example generated with libuuid.  It should be assigned when the connection is created, and never changed as long as the connection still applies to the same network.  For example, it should not be changed when the "id" property or NMSettingIP4Config changes, but might need to be re-created when the Wi-Fi SSID, mobile broadband network provider, or "type" property changes. The UUID must be in the format "2815492f-7e56-435e-b2e9-246bd7cdc664" (ie, contains only hexadecimal characters and "-").</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">wait-device-timeout</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">int32</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">-1</pre></td>
<td>Timeout in milliseconds to wait for device at startup. During boot, devices may take a while to be detected by the driver. This property will cause to delay NetworkManager-wait-online.service and nm-online to give the device a chance to appear. Note that this property only works together with NMSettingConnection:interface-name to identify the device that will be waited for. The value 0 means no wait time. The default value is -1, which currently has the same meaning as no wait time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">zone</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>The trust level of a the connection.  Free form case-insensitive string (for example "Home", "Work", "Public").  NULL or unspecified zone means the connection will be placed in the default zone as defined by the firewall. When updating this property on a currently activated connection, the change takes effect immediately.</td>
